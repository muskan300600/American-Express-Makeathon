Uncertainty is inherent in every financial model. Changing fundamentals, human psychology, inflation data, consumer spending figures and quarterly GDP calculations can all impact market performance. Volatility is widely accepted as a practical measure of risk. Most market variables remain largely unpredictable, but volatility has certain characteristics that can increase the accuracy of its forecasted values. We would thus be prediting these fluctuations in prices. Volatility prediction is one of the most important and, at the same time, more achievable goals for anyone allocating risk and participating in financial markets. The volatility of asset returns is a measure of how much the return fluctuates around its mean.
